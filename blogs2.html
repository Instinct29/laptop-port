                <h1>Boxing in Todays Era</h1>
                <p style="font-family: 'Cookie', cursive;font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;
                font-size: larger ;">History of boxing - Boxing is a fighting sports in which two people usually wears protecting box gloves for less damage as it is a sports and other protective gears such hand wraps, L guard, mouthPiece to protect themselves and throw punches at each other for a limited amount of time if a player is able to knockout other then he is declared as a Winner otherwise disicion goes to the refree called as anonymus descision <br>
                 boxing has been a popular sports since 688BC it is been played in olympics and different different world titles, There are two type of boxing AMATURE which refers to the olympic games, commomwealth Games, Asian games and is more protective then profressional boxind and has less time rounds 
                 <br>
                 On the other hand we have Professional boxing which is less protective which has more time rounds. professional boxing is much more famous then amature boxing because it is more deadly and entertaining
                 Era of professional boxing has been way better than it is right now -
                 in older times we had great boxing bouts which were way more real and compititive.
                 old boxing has great boxers like Mhd Ali, Foreman, sunny liston there was compition before older era had great boxers in every division whether it was Light weight, Middle Weight, Heavy weight.
                 Mike tyson the name itself is enough to describe an Great Boxing era, Ali the G.O.A.T name it self is enough to describe a golden boxing era. We had a good era till floydMaywether, MannyPaccman, Broner Maidana had fought - 
                 but in todays era there are no good fighters except some in each weight divisions like Canelo , Tank, Tyson fury, Wilder ,Usyk, Ant Josua - fights are not entertaining anymore because these peoples has concured the divisions therefore there is no more compition in fights. What are other boxers doing? - either flexing on instagram or faking boxing reels! This era is no Good. We have boxers like Jake paul, Logan Paul bunch of youtube creators boxing where is class? lol - most of the fights are rigged, payed by the rich boxers therefore there is no fun now.
                 <br>
                 MMA has great future than boxing, boxing is dying day by day the era is no good-
                 <br>
                 A classic "boxer" or stylist (also known as an "out-fighter") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. Talking  about ali here its his style of boxing
